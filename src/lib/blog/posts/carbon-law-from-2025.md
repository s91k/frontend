## 1. What is Carbon Law?

The **Carbon Law**, proposed by Johan Rockström, Johan Falk, and Owen Gaffney in 2017, is a science-based framework that outlines how the world can limit global warming to well below 2°C, aiming for 1.5°C. 

Inspired by Moore’s Law, it calls for exponential reductions in global CO₂ emissions and provides a roadmap for governments, businesses, and cities.

**Core Concept of the Carbon Law:**

**1.** Halve global CO₂ emissions every decade from 2020 onward.  
**2.** Double carbon removal technologies and capacity every decade.  
**3.** Reach net-zero emissions by around 2050.   

As of 2025, we're **five years behind** this trajectory. Emissions are still rising, and the global carbon budget to stay below 1.5°C has shrunk. At current levels, it will run out in only six years. 

**Klimatkollen’s response:**  
Klimatkollen has calculated a new pace of emissions reductions needed to stay within the remaining budget, based on 2025 as a starting point. It aims to give states, organisations and companies a rule of thumb by which to measure science-aligned emission cuts.

## 2. What is Klimatkollen’s adjusted emission reduction trajectory?

Using 2024 emissions data and the **Global Carbon Budget 2024**, Klimatkollen has recalculated the reduction path needed to stay within the 1.5°C budget.

- **Updated rule of thumb:** Halve emissions every 5 years starting in 2025  
- **Equivalent to:** ~12% reduction per year  
- **Purpose:** A yardstick for companies, governments, and individuals to track progress

## 3. What are the details behind Klimatkollen’s calculations?

Klimatkollen has used  the original method and principles of Carbon Law (2017) and calculated an adjusted carbon emissions reductions trajectory, based on the remaining global carbon budget for staying below 1.5°C.  

*Results of Klimatkollen’s calculations*
The data below shows carbon budgets for 50% chance of staying below 1.5, 1.7 and 2°C of global warming. These numbers come from the Global Carbon Budget 2024, and apply from January 2025 to 2050. 

**Warming Level 1.5°C**
- 50% Chance Budget: 305 GtCO₂
- Annual Reduction Rate: 11.72%

**Warming Level 1.7°C**
- 50% Chance Budget: 655 GtCO₂
- Annual Reduction Rate: 7.38%

**Warming Level 2.0°C**
- 50% Chance Budget: 1,155 GtCO₂
- Annual Reduction Rate: 7.38%


**Assumptions:**
Our calculations assume residual emissions of 5.5 GtCO₂ in 2050 and are based on a 50% chance of not exceeding 1.5°C. *(Source: All options, not silver bullets, needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C: a scenario appraisal, 2023)*

The annual 12% reduction pace does not take into account equity or individual entities' ability to transform their operations, but should be used as a rule of thumb to illustrate the pace needed globally to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

## 4. Why recalculate the original Carbon Law?

Klimatkollen’s goal is to create the public pressure needed on decision makers to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. To this end we publish data and visualizations aimed at a broad public audience, and work with media and partners to raise awareness and spark action. Our mission is to communicate clearly, and show facts as they are. 

The public has a right to know what the Paris Agreement and the 1.5°C limit means in practice.

The original Carbon Law has been hugely influential in providing this measuring stick: a halving of emissions every ten years, starting 2030. However, we are now five years behind the original Carbon Law, and running out of carbon budget. 

Due to that fact that the world has not followed **The Carbon Law** (halve global emission every 10 years from 2020 - i.e. 7% reduction per year) we need to recalculate the required trajectory - the "rule of thumb". The new proposed trajectory reflects this and provides a benchmark starting **2025**.

## 5. What if a company doesn’t meet the 12% annual cuts?

There are no legal obligations, but:

- It highlights the **step-change** needed to prevent the most disastrous consequences of a rapidly heating planet.
- Cutting all GHGs and scaling removals is critical.
- “It’s never too late” — every tonne and degree fraction matters.

---

## 6. Why is 1.5°C important? Isn’t it too late?

It’s a code red for humanity. Emissions are still rising, global warming is accelerating, and the remaining carbon budget to keep global warming under 1.5°C – the safe operating space for humanity – is vanishing rapidly.

We are in the race of our lives: to decarbonise our economies, and scale up the solutions. Every tonne emitted counts. And staying below 1.5°C of global warming should be our utmost priority – billions of lives depend on our actions today.

> **“Go beyond 1.5°C warming, a place our civilisations have never experienced and Earth has not seen in the last 100,000 years, and we will not only see major human and economic damage, but are likely to cross multiple Earth system tipping points, causing amplified warming with billions of people affected.” – Johan Rockström**

## 7. What is the global carbon budget?

A carbon budget defines the total amount of CO₂ that can be emitted into the atmosphere while still keeping global warming below a certain target, such as 1.5°C. Note that carbon budgets relate to anthropogenic fossil CO₂ emissions only. However, other greenhouse gases have a significant impact on the climate. 

**Factors affecting calculations of a global carbon budget:**
- Different temperature scenarios (1.5, 1.7, 2°C)  
- Confidence level, or the likelihood of staying below that temperature (50%, 67%, 83%)  
- Role of **Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)** could play to plausibly adress hard-to-abate emissions
- Residual emissions considered

Klimatkollen uses:
- IPCC-based carbon budget from **Global Carbon Budget 2024**  
- 50% chance to stay below 1.5°C  
- Assumes 5.5 GtCO₂ of CDR by 2050
- Timespan of Jan 2025 to 2050

## 8. What does this mean for companies?

Klimatkollen provides visualisations to show how each company compares to the 12%/year pathway.

- Companies can use this as a **common reference**, regardless of base year or sector. 
- **Scope 3 emissions** (value chain) have been and are particularly challenging to reduce, but companies should be able to take advantage of the general movement in renewable energy and climate solutions moving forward.  
- Some rapidly growing climate-solution companies may motivate raised emissions over a period of time (e.g. renewable energy firms), since their solutions will displace the fossil-based products. (Example: [Exoponential Roadmap Initiative](https://exponentialroadmap.org/climate-solutions-framework/))

## What about other greenhouse gases?

The Carbon Law calculations **only cover CO₂**, not other gases like **methane**, which behave differently.

- Methane diffuses faster; CO₂ persists for centuries; [read more](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_Chapter_05.pdf).
- **Rapid cuts** in all GHGs are still essential.
