# Klimatkollen Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se), developed using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Klimatkollen is an open-source, citizen-driven platform designed to visualize climate data. Currently, we are showcasing data from major Swedish companies and Swedish municipalities.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **`src/pages/`**: Contains `.tsx` files for each page, which are routed based on their filenames
- **`src/components/`**: Houses reusable React components utilized throughout the application
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets such as images

## 🗄️ Deciding on backend to run development client against

To run the local development client, you must run our API locally or connect to our production API. For information on setting up the API locally, see the [README](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/garbo) in our data pipeline repository.

If you instead want to run the local development client against production,
setup the local `.env` file for development by running the following command in
the root directory of the frontend code.

```
cp .env.example .env.development
```

## 🧞 Building and Running Locally 

To run the project locally, execute the following commands from the root of the project in your terminal:

| Command           | Action                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                         |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:5173` or
VITE_API_PROXY   |
| `npm run dev-gen` | Starts local dev server and regenerates API types from OpenAPI |
| `npm run generate-api` | Regenerates `src/lib/api-types.ts` from production OpenAPI (`/reference/openapi.json`) |
| `npm run generate-api:local` | Same, from local Garbo (`http://localhost:3000/reference/openapi.json`) |
| `npm run generate-api:staging` | Same, from staging API | 
| `npm run build`   | Builds your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Previews your build locally, before deploying |
|| `npm run build:dataguide` | Builds the data guide from markdown files in `src/locales/dataguide/` - run this when making changes to data guide content |

**Note:** When making changes to the data guide content (markdown files in `src/locales/dataguide/`), you need to run `npm run build:dataguide` to generate the updated JSON files. This step is automatically included when running `npm run build` for production builds.

**Note:** npm audit vulnerabilities will fail the build.

### Company IDs and API types

Companies are keyed by internal UUID (`Company.id`) in the database. The frontend uses two identifier shapes:

| Use case | Identifier |
|----------|------------|
| Public URLs (`/companies/...`) | `wikidataId` if set, else first 8 hex chars of `id` |
| Partner read (`getCompanyDetails`) | URL param as-is — API resolves Q-id, full UUID, or 8-char prefix |
| Staff create (`createCompany`) | Always full internal `company.id` in response |

Helpers live in `src/utils/companyRouting.ts` (`getCompanyUrlSegment`, `getCompanyDetailPath`).

After the API with staff `/:id` routes is deployed, regenerate OpenAPI types before building against production:

```bash
npm run generate-api:staging   # or generate-api:local against a running API
```

Do not hand-edit `src/lib/api-types.ts` except when temporarily ahead of a staged OpenAPI publish.
